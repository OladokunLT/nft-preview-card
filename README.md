## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
I learned new ways of using _background-image_ and _opacity_ properties to style the hero sections.

I had tough time styling the hero, I'd expected that _z-index_ property would work, but it end up frustrating my effort. I wish someone could give hint on how to use _z-index_ to style the hero section.
